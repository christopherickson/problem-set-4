# Overview

Take the [datacamp course on joining data](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-r-with-dplyr) to learn the join verbs.

You will analyze some data in the [`nihexporter`](https://github.com/jayhesselberth/nihexporter) package to answer some questions. The questions will cover methods in `dplyr` including two-table verbs.

First you need to install the `nihexporter` package (and `devtools`, if you don't have it already).

```r
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github("jayhesselberth/nihexporter")
```

Read the [Overview vignette](http://jayhesselberth.github.io/nihexporter/articles/nihexporter.html) to learn the structure of the pacakge. Take a look at two tables from the package:

```{r overview}
library(nihexporter) #data
library(tidyverse) #for data arrangement, analysis, presentation
library(broom) #for tidying data

projects
project_io
```

# Problems

## Problem 1

The `projects` and `project_io` tables have the `r intersect(names(projects), names(project_io))` column in common. Use this column to perform a `left_join` and identify the most expensive project for each institute. Project institutes are in the `projects` table, whereas total project costs are available in the `project_io` table. Note you will have to use the `arrange` and `slice` verbs from `dplyr`.

```{r problem_1, eval=TRUE}
projects %>% select(project.num, institute) %>%
  left_join(project_io) %>% 
  select(project.num, institute, total.cost) -> combined 
  group_by(combined, institute) %>%
  arrange(desc(total.cost)) %>%
  slice(1:1) %>%       #Slice extracts the top one row from each group (1:2 would take top 2 rows, etc)
  arrange(desc(total.cost)) -> top_25
  top_25
  
```

## Problem 2

Create a plot that describes the change in output (number of publications) for the most expensive grant from the above list. Note that you cannot use `n.pubs` for this, as that is an aggregate count over time. You need a tbl of following structure, which you can then use to calculate the number of publications each year (hint: use `n()` in a `summarize` statement:

```{r p2_tbl}

ungroup(top_25) %>% # Have to ungroup to separate the institutes
  slice(1:1) -> top_project 
  projects %>%
  semi_join(top_project, by = "project.num") %>% #Semi-join returns all rows from 'projects' that have matching project.num values from the 'top-project'. This is a filtering join.
  left_join(publinks) %>% #Left_join adds the pmid to the previous tbl, based on the common project.num value. This is a mutating join.
  left_join(publications) %>% #Left_join adds other publication data based on the pmid value
  select(project.num, pub.year, fy.cost, pmid) %>%
  na.omit() -> top_data
  
  top_data %>% group_by(pub.year) %>% 
  summarize(total.pubs = n()) -> total_pubs
  
  ggplot(total_pubs, aes(pub.year, total.pubs)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
  
```

## Problem 3

Use the `projects` and `clinical_studies` table to calculate how many clinical studies have been started by projects from each institute.

```{r problem_3}

#First, we want only the rows of 'projects' that are found in 'clinical_studies'. We can do this by joining with innerjoin. We can then group by the institute and find the number or projects using summarise.

inner_join(clinical_studies, projects, by = "project.num") %>% #Inner_join returns only the rows in clinical_studies that match the projects. Because project.num is the only common column between these tbls, could also use left_join here. 
group_by(institute) %>%
filter(!is.na(institute)) %>% 
summarise(num_proj = n()) 


```

## Problem 4

Calculate correlations between `total.cost` and `n.pubs` for each institute. You will need to `join` the `projects` and `project_io` tables to link `institute` with `total.cost` and `n.pubs`. You will then need to use `group_by` and `do` from `dplyr` and `tidy` from `broom` to calculate correlations.

```{r problem_4, eval=TRUE}

left_join(projects, project_io, by = "project.num") %>% #Left_join to add all columns from project_io to the projects tbl. Could also use inner_join, becasue the only common column is project.num, so no data would be lost. 
  select(institute, n.pubs, total.cost) %>% #Selecting only these columns
  group_by(institute) %>% #Grouping by institute
  na.omit() %>%
  do(tidy(cor(.$total.cost, .$n.pubs))) 

```

## Problem 5 (extra credit)

Correlate [`rcr`](https://icite.od.nih.gov/) values from the `publications` table to one of:

- total cost (overall for NIH, or by institute)
- budget mechanism (e.g., RFA, PAR, etc.)
- type of grant (e.g. R01, P01, R21, etc.). 

```{r extra_credit}
#Calculate the correlation between rcr and total cost for all funding types. 

inner_join(publinks, projects, by = "project.num") %>%
  left_join(publications, by = "pmid") %>%
  left_join(project_io, by = "project.num") %>% 
  na.omit(rcr) -> compiled
  group_by(compiled, activity) %>% 
  do(tidy(cor(.$total.cost, .$rcr)))


```

## Problem 6 (extra extra credit)

Use [`gganimate`](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate) to illustrate the change in cost of R01s for a few institutes over time.

```{r extra_extra_credit}

library(gganimate)
group_by(compiled, total.cost, activity, fiscal.year)
filter(compiled, activity == "R01", institute %in% c("AA", "AG", "AI", "AR", "AT")) -> compiled2
plotme <- ggplot(compiled2, aes(fiscal.year, total.cost, frame = fiscal.year, color = factor(institute))) + geom_point()

gganimate(plotme, "name.gif")

```
